# SCS2013 Exercise 05 (2022 Fall)

**This exercise notebook will go through the "Conditional" and "Loop" statements in Python**

* "if" statement 
* "if-elif-else"
* "For" loop
* "While" loop


## If Statement: Conditional statements (조건문)

With conditional statements, we can control the flow of execution by using certain statements. **"if" statements** are very useful whenever we need a conditional execution.

**Syntax**
```
if <condition>:
  <statement>
```
- starts with **"if"**, followed by a ``<condition>``, and ends with colon **colon :**
- the ``<condition>`` is evaluated as a *Boolean*: either True or False
- the ``<statement>`` is a code block to be executed
- each line of ``<statement>`` must **indented**: 4 spaces or a tab





```python
# if
x = 3
if x < 10:
  print('x is less than 10')

if x > 10:
  print('x is greater than 10')

if x > 2 and x < 5:
  print('x is in range (2,5)')
```


```python
# indentation
x = 1
y = 8

if x > y:
  print('x is %d and y is %d' %(x,y))  
  print('x is greater than y')
print('nothing')
```

    nothing
    

### If-Elif-Else Statement

* **if-else**: Make more detailed conditional statements if we use **"else"** statement. 

```
if <condition>:
  <statement 1>
else:
  <statement 2>
```

- if ``<condition>`` is True, the program quits after executing ``<statement 1>``.
- if ``<condition>`` is False, the program quits after executing ``<statement 2>``.



```python
# if-else

#x = 1
x = 2
if x == 1:
  print('If statement')
  print("SCS2013 If statement!")
else:
  print('Else statement')
  print("SCS2013 Else statement!")
```

    Else statement
    SCS2013 Else statement!
    


```python
# if-else

isStudent = True
year = 2019

if isStudent and year == 2022: 
  print('I am a freshman in university')
else:
  print('I am a student but not a freshman')
```

    I am a student but not a freshman
    

* **if-elif-else**: Can use an **"elif"** between "if" and "else" as an additional conditional statement. We can evaluate several conditional cases by using "elif". 

```
if <condition A>:
  <statement 1>
elif <condition B>:
  <statement 2>
elif <condition C>:
  <statement 3>
else:
  <statement 4>
```

- if ``<condition A>`` is True, the program quits after executing ``<statement 1>``.
- if ``<condition A>`` is False and ``<condition B>`` is True, the program quits after executing ``<statement 2>``.
- if ``<condition A>, <condition B>`` are False and ``<condition C>`` is True, the program quits after executing ``<statement 3>``.
- otherwise (= all ``<condition A>, <condition B>, <condition C>`` are False), the program quits after executing  ``<statement 4>``. 




```python
# if-elif-else

x = 3
if x < 2:
  print('If: x is less than 2')
elif x < 10:
  print('Elif: x is greater than or equal to 2')
  print('And x is less than 10')
elif x < 20:
  print('Elif: x is greater than or equal to 2, and x is greater than or equal to 10')
  print('And x is less than 20')
else:
  print('Else: x is greater than or equal to 20')
```


```python
# if-elif-else

score = 90
if 80 < score <= 100:
  print('A-level')
elif 60 < score <= 80:
  print('B-level')
elif 40 < score <= 60:
  print('C-level')
elif 20 < score <= 40:
  print('D-level')
else:
  print('E-level')
```

**Nested If Statements**: Nested if can be useful when we need to expand several conditional statements. 




```python
# nested if

# x = 3
# y = "Hello"

# x = 3
# y = 'Wow'

x = 7
#y = 'Hello'
y = 'Wow'

x = 3
y = "Hello"

if x < 5:
  if y == "Hello":
    x = 0
  else:
    y = "Hi"
else:
  x = 10

print(f'x is {x} and y is {y}')
```

### Pass statement and Conditional expressions

A pass statement is a **null** statement - when it is executed, nothing happens. When a statement is syntatically required but you have nothing specific to do - then we need to use a 'pass' statement.



A conditional expression is a concise version of `if-else` statement: write if in one line



```python
i = 1

if i > 7:
  pass
else:
  print(i)
  print('i is less than 7 - you are in "else" statement')
```


```python
# if-else statement 
a = 1
if a % 2 == 0:
  result = 'even'
else:
  result = 'odd'

print(result)
```


```python
# conditional expression
a = 1
result = 'even' if a % 2 == 0 else 'odd'
print(result)
```

### User input and Random number

- User input: `input()`
  - we can ask the user for input
  - use the `input()` method
  - entered input value is always a string - we need to convert it if we want to use it as numerical value


- Random number generator: `random.randint(start, end)`
  - need to `import random` first!
  - return a random number between `start` and `end` (both included) 



```python
# user input
num1 = input('Num1: ')
print(f'Input num1 is {num1}, type: {type(num1)}')    ## 무엇을 입력하든 문자열 string으로 받아들인다!!

num2 = int(input('Num2: '))
print(f'Input num2 is {num2}, type: {type(num2)}')    ## 형변환
```

    Num1: 123
    Input num1 is 123, type: <class 'str'>
    Num2: 123123123
    Input num2 is 123123123, type: <class 'int'>
    


```python
# user input
name = input('What is your name: ')
age = int(input('What is your age: '))

print(f'My name is {name}! I\'m {age} years old')
```


```python
# random integer
import random 
num=0

while num!=1:
  num = random.randint(1,10)   ## 시작과 끝 모두 포함 주의. range()와 차이점
  print(num)
```

## Loop statements (반복문)

**Loop** is a very powerful concept to execute a task in iterations:



### For Loop
**For loop** is used for repeating a task for a desired number of times.

```
for iterator in iterable:
  <statement>
```
- iterator: a variable that is used to iterate through the collection 
- iterable: a sequence or collection through which iteation happens in for loops 
  - list ``['a','b','c']``, range ``range(3)``, tuple ``(1,2,3)``, ... 
- statement: code block to be executed during each iteration in the loop - must **indented**



```python
# list 
a = ['a','b','c']
print(a)

a = [0,1,2]
print(a)
```


```python
# range()
b = range(3)
print(b)
print(tuple(b))

print(b[0])
print(b[1])
print(b[2])

c = range(1,11)
print(c)
print(list(c))

print(c[0])
print(c[3])

d = range(1, 11, 2)
print(d)
print(list(d))
```

    range(0, 3)
    (0, 1, 2)
    0
    1
    2
    range(1, 11)
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    1
    4
    range(1, 11, 2)
    [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
    


```python
# 1: without for loop, print each element of ['a','b','c']

lst = ['a','b','c']

val = lst[0]
print(val)

val = lst[1]
print(val)

val = lst[2]
print(val)

# 1: with for loop, print each element of ['a','b','c']

lst = ['a','b','c']
for val in lst:
  print(val)
```


```python
for val in range(2, 20, 3):
  print(val)
```


```python
# 2

for iter in ['a','b','c']:
  print(f'Hi! {iter}')

print('=====')
for iter in range(5):
  i_str = 'Hi'*iter
  print(i_str)
```

    Hi! a
    Hi! b
    Hi! c
    =====
    
    Hi
    HiHi
    HiHiHi
    HiHiHiHi
    


```python
# 3: compute a sum and product of all numbers from 1 to 4

sum = 0 
for i in range(1,5):
  sum = sum+i
  print(sum)

print('=====')

product = 1
for i in range(1,5):
  product *= i
  print(product)
```


```python
# 4: a loop that prints all odd numbers in [1,10]

for i in range(1,11):
  if i % 2 == 1:
    print(f'{i} is an odd number')
```


```python
# 5: given a sentence, print each word

my_str = 'One year has 12 months, 52 weeks and 365 days'
my_lst = my_str.split()

print(my_lst)

for i in my_lst:
  print(i)
```

    ['One', 'year', 'has', '12', 'months,', '52', 'weeks', 'and', '365', 'days']
    One
    year
    has
    12
    months,
    52
    weeks
    and
    365
    days
    


```python
# 6: given a dictionary, print each key and value 

my_dict = {'name': 'Peter', 'birth': ['April', 9], 'age': 27, 'year': 1995, 'Course': 'SCS2013'}
print(type(my_dict.keys()))

for key in my_dict.keys():
  print(f'Key: {key} and Value: {my_dict[key]}')

print('=====')
print(type(my_dict.items()))
print(my_dict.items())
for (key, value) in my_dict.items():
  print(f'Key: {key} and Value: {value}')
```

    <class 'dict_keys'>
    Key: name and Value: Peter
    Key: birth and Value: ['April', 9]
    Key: age and Value: 27
    Key: year and Value: 1995
    Key: Course and Value: SCS2013
    =====
    <class 'dict_items'>
    dict_items([('name', 'Peter'), ('birth', ['April', 9]), ('age', 27), ('year', 1995), ('Course', 'SCS2013')])
    Key: name and Value: Peter
    Key: birth and Value: ['April', 9]
    Key: age and Value: 27
    Key: year and Value: 1995
    Key: Course and Value: SCS2013
    


```python
# Nested for loop

num = 5
for i in range(1,num+1):
  print(f'Line {i}:', end=' ')
  for j in range(1,i+1):
    print(j, end=' ')

  print('')
```

### While Loop

**While Loop** is another powerful repetition structure in Python. 

```
while <condition>:
  <statement>
```

It executes the ``<statement>`` as long as the ``<condition>`` is satisfied.


```python
# 1 
i = 0
while i < 3:
  print('Hello World!')
  i = i + 1
```

    Hello World!
    Hello World!
    Hello World!
    


```python
# 2
num_boxes = 3
while num_boxes > 0:
  print(f'There are {num_boxes} boxes. Remove one.')
  num_boxes -= 1
  print(f'There are {num_boxes} boxes left.')

  if num_boxes == 0:
    print('There is no box!')
    
```

### Break, Continue Statements

* A **break** statement terminates the loop
* A **continue** statement skips a code block in the loop for the current iteration.


```python
i = 10

while i > 0:
  i = i-1
  if i > 7:
    continue
  elif i < 3:
    break
  else:
    print(i)
```

    7
    6
    5
    4
    3
    


```python
for i in range(10):
  if i % 3 == 0:
    continue
  if i == 8:
    break

  print(i)
```

    1
    2
    4
    5
    7
    


```python
count_even = 0
count_odd = 0

while True:
  val = int(input('Enter an integer: '))
  if val == 10:
    break
  elif val % 2 == 0: 
    count_even += 1
  else: 
    count_odd += 1

print(f'Finish the loop: number of evens {count_even} and number of odds {count_odd}')
```

    Enter an integer: 20
    Enter an integer: 14
    Enter an integer: 23
    Enter an integer: 55
    Enter an integer: 10
    Finish the loop: number of evens 2 and number of odds 2
    

## input() and random.randint()

Python allows for user input: we are able to ask the user for input.

Syntax of `input()`

```
input([prompt])
```
- If you enter an integer or float number, it will convert it into a **string**. If you want input in other data types, need to perform **type conversion** on the input value.



```python
# take name and age values from user
name = input('Enter Name: ')
age = input('Enter Age: ')

print('\n')
print(f'Name: {name}, Age: {age}')
print('Print type of each input value')
print(f'Type of name {type(name)}, Type of age {type(age)}')
```


```python
first_num = input('Enter first number (integer): ')
second_num = input('Enter second number (float): ')

print('\n')
print(f'First number {first_num} and Second number {second_num}')
print(f'First num + Second num = {first_num + second_num}')

print('\nType conversion')
first_num = int(first_num)
second_num = float(second_num)
print(f'First number {first_num} and Second number {second_num}')
print(f'First num + Second num = {first_num + second_num}')
```

By doing `import random`, we can handle 'random' numbers: 

Syntax of `random.randint()`
```
import random
random.randint(start, end, step)
```
- If generates a random number (integer) between 'start' and 'end' (both included).



```python
import random

num = random.randint(1,10)
print(num)

num = random.randint(1,10)
print(num)

num = random.randint(1,10)
print(num)
```

## Exercise

Let's try some exercises that will help understand conditional statements and loop statements.

### E-1

Write a program that finds the decimal part (소수점 이하) of `num` and print "The decimal part of `num` is `decimal part`". 

If decimal part is zero, print "`num` is an integer".

*hint*: you can use `int()` function or use `%` operator to find the decimal part. 

*expected result*: when `num = 11.11`
```
The decimal part of 11.11 is 0.110
```
when `num = 11`
```
11 is an integer
```


```python
num = 11.11
#num = 11

# your code here
d_part = num % int(num)
if d_part == 0 :
  print(f'{num} is an integer')
else:
  print(f'The decimal part of {num} is {d_part:.3f}')

## 1로 나눈 나머지를 이용해도 된다
## int 쓸거면 그냥 int(num)이 정수부분이니까 소수부분은 num - int(num)
```

    11 is an integer
    

### E-2

Write a program that counts the number of words that start with a letter `C` or `c` in a string `my_str`. 

```
my_str = "Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you. Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves."
```


```python
my_str = '''Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you. Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.'''

result = 0

# your code here: use for, if, and pass

lst = my_str.split()

for i in lst:
  if i[0] == 'c' or i[0] == 'C':
    result+=1

print(result)





```

    ['Never', 'again', 'will', 'you', 'be', 'capable', 'of', 'ordinary', 'human', 'feeling.', 'Everything', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'inside', 'you.', 'Never', 'again', 'will', 'you', 'be', 'capable', 'of', 'love,', 'or', 'friendship,', 'or', 'joy', 'of', 'living,', 'or', 'laughter,', 'or', 'curiosity,', 'or', 'courage,', 'or', 'integrity.', 'You', 'will', 'be', 'hollow.', 'We', 'shall', 'squeeze', 'you', 'empty,', 'and', 'then', 'we', 'shall', 'fill', 'you', 'with', 'ourselves.']
    4
    

### E-3

Given the list, write a program that follows the below rule: You can use `for` and `if-elif-else`.

- print the number if it is multiple of 5
- if the number is greater than 200, stop the loop 
- if the number is less than 100, skip the iteration and move to the next number


Given the list `lst = [125, 12, 50, 160, 198, 250, 721, 110]`, the result will be:
```
125
160
```


```python
lst = [125, 12, 50, 160, 198, 250, 721, 110]

# your code here

for n in lst :
  if n>200:
    break
  if n<100:
    continue
  if n % 5 == 0:
    print(n)

## 교수님은 elif를 쓰셨지만... 여기서는 굳이?인듯 

```

    125
    160
    

### E-4

Print numbers from 10 to 1 - in the backward direction - using the 'while' loop.


```python
# your code here

i=11

while i>=1:
  
  i-=1
  print(i)
  if i==1:
    break

i=10
while True :
  print(i)
  i-=1
  if i==0:
    break

```

    10
    9
    8
    7
    6
    5
    4
    3
    2
    1
    10
    9
    8
    7
    6
    5
    4
    3
    2
    1
    

### E-5

We have generated two random integers between 1 and 50, and ask the user to compute the subtraction: Please check the entered answer is correct or not.

Example of results will be:
```
What is 22 - 34?: 
>> -12
Great!
```
```
What is 44 - 34?: 
>> 5
Wrong!
```





```python
import random 

x = random.randint(1,50)
y = random.randint(1,50)

answer = int(input(f'What is {x} - {y}?: '))

# your code here: check whether the entered answer is correct or not

if answer == x - y:
  print('Great!')
else:
  print('Wrong!')


```

    What is 26 - 46?: 5
    Wrong
    

### E-6

Write a program that generates and prints a random number as long as the number is not 0. (Use `while` loop)

- *note*: you can generate a random integer in $[0, 10]$ by using `random.randint(0,10)`
- but you first need to import `import random` in order to use `random.randint()` function


One example of result will be:
```
Number is 10
Number is 2
Number is 3
Stop
```


```python
import random 


num = random.randint(0,10)
# your code here: generate a random number as long as the number is not 0

while num!=0:
  print(f'Number is {num}')
  num = random.randint(0,10)
  

print('Stop')

while True:
  num=random.randint(0,10)
  if num==0:
    print('Stop')
    break
  else:
    print(f'Number is {num}')
  
```

    Number is 8
    Number is 8
    Number is 3
    Number is 3
    Number is 2
    Number is 4
    Number is 6
    Number is 4

    Stop
    Number is 7
    Number is 2
    Number is 6
    Number is 3
    Number is 6
    Number is 1
    Number is 10

    Number is 10
    Number is 3
    Number is 5
    Number is 7
    Number is 8
    Stop
    

### E-7

Take input integers from the user repeatedly and compute the total sum of the entered integers. The loop continues until the user enters `0`.

- hint: we can use ` while True` and `break` for this 

Example of result:
```
Enter an integer: 3
Enter an integer: 5
Enter an integer: 2
Enter an integer: 0
Finish the loop: total sum is 10
```


```python
sum = 0

# your code here: take input integers from user repeatedly and compute the total sum


# 방법1
while True:
  val = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
  if val==0:
    break
  sum+=val

# 방법2
# val = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
# while val != 0 :
#   sum+=val
#   val = int(input("Enter an integer: "))


print(f'Finish the loop: total sum is {sum}')
```

    Enter an integer: 3
    Enter an integer: 5
    Enter an integer: 2
    Enter an integer: 0
    Finish the loop: total sum is 10
