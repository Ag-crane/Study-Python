# SCS2013 Exercise 12 (2022 Fall)

**This exercise notebook will go through the understanding of "File Input/Output" and some "Modules"**

- File input and output
- Some popular built-in modules





Let's first create a file and save it to a temporary location in Colab

```

```

- First click the folder icon at the left panel 

- Right click -> create a new file and name it `data.txt`

- Double clicking the file, you can see the text editor on the right side.

- Please copy and paste the above text to the file and save it. 

## File Input & Output

**Files** are named locations on disk to store related information - used to permanently store data in a hard disk. A file operation in Python takes place in the following order:

- **open** a file
- **read** or **write** 
- **close** the file

Before to start, we need to know a *file path* that defines the location of a file or folder in the conmputer system. 
- You can use "absolute path" or "relative path" 
- absolute path begins with the root folder
- relative path is the location relative to the current working directory

**os** module: provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality


```python
import os
```


```python
os.getcwd()
```




    '/content'




```python
os.listdir('/content/sample_data')
```




    ['README.md',
     'anscombe.json',
     'mnist_train_small.csv',
     'mnist_test.csv',
     'california_housing_test.csv',
     'california_housing_train.csv']



### Opening Files in Python

Python has a built-in `open()` function to open a file. 

```
open(file, mode)
```
- we can specify the `mode` while opening a file: whether we want to read, write, or append, ... 
- when working with files in text mode, it is recommended to specify the encoding type


```python
f = open('data.txt')
f = open('data.txt', mode='r', encoding='utf-8')
```

### Closing Files in Python

1. Python has a built-in `close()` method to close a file. When we are done with some operations on the file, we need to properly close the file - it will free up the resources that were assigned with the file. 

```
f.close()
```
- it flush and close the file IO object


2. If an exception occurs when we are performing some operation with the file, the code exits without closing the file. Another way (more safe) to close a file is to use a `try...except...finally` block. 

```
try:     
  # open a file
  # some operations 
except:
  # error handling
finally:      
  # close the file 
```

3. The best way to close a file is by using the `with` statement. It ensures that the file is closed when the block inside the `with` statement is exited. The method `close()` is called internally.

```
with open() as f:     
  # some operations
```


```python
# open a file
f = open('data.txt', mode='r', encoding='utf-8')
#f = open('data2.txt', mode='r', encoding='utf-8')

# and close the file
f.close()
```


```python
# open and close a file with try...finally
try:
  f = open('data.txt', mode='r', encoding='utf-8')
  #f = open('data2.txt', mode='r', encoding='utf-8')
except:
  print('Error: File operation')
finally:
  f.close()
```


```python
# open by using with 
with open('data.txt', mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
  # some operations
  pass
```

### Writing to Files & Reading Files in Python

We can create a Empty text file by using `open()` with the access mode: w, x, a, t, b
- `w`: create a new file for writing. If a file already exists, it overwrites into the file 
- `x`: open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, this operation fails
- `a`: open a file in the append mode and add new content at the end of the file. 



```python
# create an empty text file with name "test.txt" in current directory
f = open('test.txt', 'w')  # 커서 맨앞에. 새로쓰기
f.close()
```


```python
f = open('test2.txt', 'x')  
f.close()
```


```python
f = open('test.txt', 'a')   # 커서 맨뒤에. 이어쓰기
f.close()
```

Now let's write a string into a new file. We can open a file for modifying or overwriting its contents by using any one of the modes: 
- `w`: for writing - overwriting if the file exists, and creating a new file if the file does not exist
- `w+`: reading and writing 
- `a`: for writing - adding a new content if the file exists, and creating a new file otherwisej
- `a+`: reading and writing 

Once a file is opened, we can write text into the file using the `write()` method
```
f.write('new text')
```
We can also use `writelines()` method to write a list of strings into a file 


```python
# with open('test.txt', mode='x') as f:
#   f.write('New text in X mode')
```


```python
with open('test.txt', mode='w') as f:
  f.write('Add a new text in W mode\n') 
```


```python
with open('test.txt', mode='a') as f:
  f.write('Add a new text in A mode\n')
```


```python
p_data = ['Name: Kim\n', 'Age: 25\n', 'City: Seoul']

with open('test.txt', mode='w') as f:
  f.writelines(p_data)  

```


```python
p_data = ['University: ABC\n', 'Skill: Python']

with open('test.txt', mode='a') as f:
  f.write('\n')
  f.writelines(p_data)
```

To read the contents of a file, we have to open a file in reading mode:       
- `r`: for reading the contents of a text file 
- `r+`: for both reading and writing 
- `w+`: for reading and writing
- `a+`: for both reading and appending 

Once a file is opened, we can read all the content of the file using the `read()` method 

```
f.read(size)
```
- it reads at most `size` characters from the file until we hit the end of the file. 

We can also use `readline(size)` to read file line by line or `readlines()` to read a list of lines from the file


**move cursor position**

The `seek()` method is used to move the file's handle position to the specified location. The cursor defines where the data has to be read or written in the file - the position is represented as index

The `tell()` method returns the current position of the file pointer from the beginning of the file 



```python
with open ('test.txt', mode='r') as f:
  print(f.read(7))
  print(f.read())
```

    Name: K
    im
    Age: 25
    City: Seoul

```python
with open ('test.txt', mode='r') as f:
  print(f.read(7))
  print(f.tell())
  f.seek(20)
  print(f.tell())
  print(f.read())
```

  for line in f:
    # print(line)
    print(line,end='')
    
```

    Name: Kim

```python
with open('test.txt', mode='r') as f:
  # read first 3 lines
  for i in range(3):
    print(f.readline(), end='')
```

    Name: Kim
    Age: 25
    City: Seoul
    


```python
with open('test.txt', mode='r') as f:
  # read lines till it reached the EOF
  line = f.readline()
  while line != '':
    print(line, end='')
    line = f.readline()
```

    Name: Kim
    Age: 25
    City: Seoul
    University: ABC
    Skill: Python


```python
with open('test.txt', mode='r') as f:
  lines = f.readlines()
  print(lines)
```

    ['Name: Kim\n', 'Age: 25\n', 'City: Seoul\n', 'University: ABC\n', 'Skill: Python']
    


```python
# read first N lines from a file
n= 2
with open('test.txt', mode='r') as f:
  lines = f.readlines()[:n]
  print(lines)
```

    ['Name: Kim\n', 'Age: 25\n']
    

Now check how to iterate over each line in the file: 


```python
with open('test.txt', mode='r') as f:
  line = f.readline()
  
  while line != '':
    print(line, end='')
    line = f.readline()
```

```python
with open('test.txt', mode='r') as f:
  for line in f:
    print(line, end='')
```

    Name: Kim
    Age: 25
    City: Seoul
    University: ABC

```python
with open('test.txt', mode='r') as f:
  for line in f.readlines():
    print(line, end='')
```

    Name: Kim
    Age: 25

    University: ABC
    Skill: Python

One more thing: use for loop with `enumerate()` method to get a line and its index number 

**enumerate()** function adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in enumerate object: 


```python
with open('test.txt', mode='r') as f:
  for line in f:
    print(line, end='')
```

    Name: Kim
    Age: 25
    City: Seoul
    University: ABC
    Skill: Python


```python
with open('test.txt', mode='r') as f:
  # print(list(enumerate(f)))

  for i, line in enumerate(f):
    print(i, line, end='')
```

### More with Files

How about writing a function that handles "files"? 

Write a function to read the content from a text file (given as argument) line by line and display the same on screen.


```python
def read_file(file_name):
  with open(file_name, mode='r') as f:
    for line in f:
      print(line, end='')
```


```python
read_file('data.txt')
```

    Welcome to SCS2013 Python Programming
    This is a data.txt
    Line 3
    Line 4
    newline
    파이썬 프로그래밍
    Last line

Write a function named `write_file(fname, str_list)`
- that takes file name `fname` and a list of strings `str_list`
- and writes a list of strings `str_list` to a file `fname`: each string is written as **one line**
- overwrite the content into the file if the file already exists



```python
def write_file(fname, str_list):
  with open(fname, mode='w') as f:
    for my_str in str_list:
      f.write(my_str+'\n')
```


```python
str_list = ['Welcome to SCS2013!', 'What is Python?', 'Python is a widely used high-level, interpreted, dynamic programming language']
write_file('test_w.txt', str_list)

with open('test_w.txt', mode='r') as f:
  print(f.read())
```

    Welcome to SCS2013!
    What is Python?
    Python is a widely used high-level, interpreted, dynamic programming language
    
    

Write a function named `count_words_file(fname)`
- that takes file name `fname`
- and counts the number of words of the file `fname` and returns it (do not care duplicates)



```python
def count_words_file(fname):
  with open(fname, mode='r') as f:
    return len(f.read().split())
```


```python
fname = 'test.txt'
num_words = count_words_file('test.txt')
print(f'The number of words in "{fname}" is {num_words}')

print('=====')

fname = 'test_w.txt'
num_words = count_words_file('test_w.txt')
print(f'The number of words in "{fname}" is {num_words}')
```

    The number of words in "test.txt" is 10
    =====
    The number of words in "test_w.txt" is 16
    

## Modules: Math, Datetime, Time

**[math](https://docs.python.org/ko/3/library/math.html)** module 

The math module provides access to the mathematical functions

- `math.pi`, `math.pow()`, `math.max()`, `math.min()`, `math.ceil()`, `math.floor()`, `math.sqrt()`, `math.sin()`, `math.cos()`, `math.tan()`, ... 


```python

```


```python
import math

# pi
print(math.pi)

# square root of number
print(math.sqrt(16))

# the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number
print(math.ceil(7.2))

# sin
print(math.sin(0.5*math.pi))
```

    3.141592653589793
    4.0

    1.0
    


```python
# compute the Pythagorean theorem: triangle side length 

side_a = 3.0
side_b = 4.0

side_c = math.sqrt(math.pow(side_a,2)+ math.pow(side_b,2))
print(f'The length of side a: {side_a}')
print(f'The length of side b: {side_b}')
print(f'The length of side c: {side_c}')
```

    The length of side a: 3.0
    The length of side b: 4.0
    The length of side c: 5.0
    

**[datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#module-datetime)** module and **[time](https://docs.python.org/ko/3/library/time.html)** module

The datetime module provides functions to handle the date and time

- it has a date, time, datetime, timezone classes
- there is a [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime) object: that contains all the information of a date and time

- datetime class has various class methods including: `datetime.today()`, `datetime.now()`, ..., and instance methods: `datetime.date()`, `datetime.time()`, `datetime.weekday()`, ...


The time module provides various functions to perform time-related activities:     

- `time.time()`: return the time in seconds since the epoch as a floating point number 

- `time.localtime(sec)`: convert to local time 

- `time.asctime(t)`: returns a readable 24-character string such as 'Tue Dec 11 18:07:14 2008'




```python
import datetime  

# get current date and time
x = datetime.datetime.now()
print(x)
print(x.year, x.month, x.day, x.hour, x.minute, x.second)
```

## Exercise for Files

### E-1

Write a function named `copy_last_file(fname1, fname2, n)` 
- that takes original file name `fname1`, new file name `fname2` and an integer `n`
- and reads the last `n` lines of the file `fname1` and write them into a new file `fname2`
